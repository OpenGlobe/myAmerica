There are many benefits of bringing these wild areas within closer reach; among them improving public health through accessible ways to exercise, reduce stress and spend time outdoors; education through better awareness of man’s impact on nature and a better understanding of ecological principles; cost affordable ways to travel and explore with friends and family; and a closer connection to our country’s diverse history.\r\n\r\nThe myAmerica initiative helps to expand and explore opportunities for citizen engagement and industry partnerships, and supports the Recreation One Stop (Rec1Stop) ongoing efforts to modernize reservations.  We're supporting interactive planning tools, integrated third party data access efforts, data transparency, field operations support, and marketing / customer service initiatives.\r\n\r\nKey Outcomes:\r\n\r\nCustomer Service for the 21st Century\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n+ Virtualize and customize a range of visitor services. \r\n+ Organize information with a commitment to user-focused design and in ways that best serve the needs of the public, vs. reflecting the information architecture of existing bureaucracies. \r\n+ Platforms to encourage development of interactive maps, podcasts, hospitality services, enhanced visitor experiences, push notifications, language translation, trip planning.\r\n\r\nEfficient and Improved Government\r\n---------------------------------\r\n+Leverage innovations across several agencies to create an integrated platform for data on all federal lands and waters. This approach will mitigate the need to recreate separate applications and websites for different public lands and waters visitor sites. \r\n+Empower local agency personnel to keep content fresh and highly relevant to the local visitor experience, but streamline the backend planning, governance, technology, evaluation and methodology.\r\n\r\nPromoting Economic Growth\r\n-------------------------\r\n+ Foster innovation by making the platform flexible and extensible to multiple modes (interactive kiosks, websites, mobile, etc.) and by making information freely available in open formats so that the private sector can leverage and expand the use of the information. \r\n+ Partnerships will expand the impact of federal efforts through collaboration and open data sharing with a broad network of potential partners who can pull information into tools and services where the public is already searching for this type of information.\r\n\r\nOther Efforts\r\n\r\nData Visualization Project\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nExisting DOI resources for content:\r\n\r\n+ http://www.doi.gov/digitalstrategy/index.cfm\r\n+ http://www.doi.gov/data/index.cfm\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
