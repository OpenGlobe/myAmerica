What is myAmerica?  myAmerica is an initiative to bring our nations lands and waters closer to the people that they collectively belong to.  There are many benefits of bringing these wild areas within closer reach; among them improving public health through accessible ways to exercise, reduce stress and spend time outdoors; education through better awareness of man’s impact on nature and a better understanding of ecological principles; cost affordable ways to travel and explore with friends and family; and a closer connection to our country’s diverse history.

Goals:

+ Improve customer services
+ Empower local agencies and partners
+ Promote economic growth
